# Quelea

This Quelea fork comes from the project authored by [Alex Fischer](https://github.com/lxfschr).
As a former project Quelea is an add-on for Grasshopper for Rhinoceros 3D. Provides easy interface to a particle, boid, and agent behaviours for design, analysis, and simulation.

This fork leverages the educational site of the former Quelea  project.
